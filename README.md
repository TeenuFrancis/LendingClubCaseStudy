## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
Univariate Analysis:
The higher number of individuals with Charged Off loans have Home Ownership as 'MORTGAGE' and 'RENT' so they are likely to default the payment.
Box plot is used for the analysis before and post removal of outliers. The low Annual Income of the customers is a cause for the defaulting of loans.
Individuals who are listed as bankrupt are less likely to pay the loan.

Correlation Coefficient:
The Funded Amount and the Interest Rate have a positive correlation, as the Funded Amount increase, the Interest Rate also increases and hence difficulty of repayment of the loan increases.

Bivariate Analysis:
The loan taken for the purpose of Car and Small business have higher delinquency as when compared to the other types of loans, hence there are more number defaulters for those who have taken Car and Small business loans.
The Fund Amounts were high for which the Delinquency is observed.
Graphs shows that there are many individuals who have been listed on derogatory Public records, those with one or more than 1 public records are likely to default the loan.
Graphs shows that there are many individuals who have been listed on Public record Bankruptcies, those with one or more than 1 public record bankruptcies are likely to default the loan.
